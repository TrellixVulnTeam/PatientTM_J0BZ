concerning his most pressing issue currently, he is continued on antibiotics for stump cellulitis. an infectious disease consult was requested, as the area of cellulitis spread with dry gangrene setting in. they did not feel that he was septic or toxic and that this most likely represented stump failure. vascular was consulted, and they too agreed that this was most likely not primarily an

consultation was obtained who recommended dressing changes and close monitoring for bone involvement. ankle-brachial index was obtained for right leg which showed low ankle-brachial index for the patient's right lower extremity. due to the patient's significant coronary history, a cardiology consultation was obtained which found the patient to have no symptoms of ischemia on electrocardiogram, but they recommended a stress test as well as an echocardiogram. a stress test sestamibi was obtained on hospital day three, which showed severe nonreversible inferior defect, moderate reversible defect at the apex, and septal defect, moderate left ventricular enlargement, with an ejection fraction of 34%, and generalized diffuse hypokinesis. the recommendation was made to hold off of the patient's distal bypass surgery until his cardiac issues were resolved. due to the patient's high blood urea nitrogen and creatinine, the renal service was consulted. they initially said that the patient did not need dialysis now; however, he would most likely be dialysis dependent within the next year. as a part of the patient's cardiology workup, a cardiac catheterization was obtained. the patient was appropriately medicated and hydrated prior to the procedure. a cardiac catheterization was performed on which showed a right-dominant minimal mitral regurgitation, the left main coronary artery was okay, the left anterior descending artery revealed total meddle left anterior descending artery occlusion was bridging collaterals, the left circumflex with minor irregularities, right coronary artery was occluded filled by left anterior descending artery and posterior descending artery. cardiothoracic surgery was consulted and recommended that the patient undergo a few sessions of

normal. gram stain was negative. she was started on vancomycin, ampicillin, acyclovir (with ivf bolus to prevent arf), and ceftriaxone. she was initially admitted to the icu for close monitoring. she was initially very confused and agitated without verbal output. she then slowly improved over the next several days, gradually speaking more and following more commands. she became more oriented to her surroundings and less agitated. the antibiotics were stopped after cultures were negative for 3 days. the acyclovir was stopped after her hsv returned negative. tox screens showed only + opiates which she is on at home. opiate overdose was considered, but not consistent with her presentation. she had an eeg which showed generalized slowing and a focal area of irritability over the left temporal region with frequent bursts over theta activity and sharp features. it was ultimately postulated that her presentation was likely due to seizure. she had no observed seizure activity. she was on dilantin for most of the hospital stay, but she easily developed toxic levels. she was therefore switched to keppra prior to discharge. two mris were performed in attempt to identify seizure focus, but the pt was unable to tolerate these studies very well due to underlying anxiety and superimposed tardive dyskinesia. therefore, no clear seizure focus was elucidated. she will follow-up in clinic after discharge. cad/htn:we continued her home plavix and asa. her antihypertensives were initially held, but were then restarted when her bp began to be elevated. these were norvasc and metoprolol. she was also started on a clonidine patch. this controlled her bp well. endocrine: she was continued on her home levoxyl. she was also continued on glargine and riss without problems. she was

early in his course, he underwent successful electric cardioversion of his atrial fibrillation. this occurred in the ccu given his progressively falling systolic blood pressures, in the setting of heart failure and initiation. fluid removal, via nesiritide and lasix was continued for a brief time in the ccu. he remained in sinus rhythm for most of the remainder of his course, with paroxysms of atrial fibrillation. his symptoms slowly improved and success was achieved in lowering his weight and oxygen requirement. nevertheless, on discharge he still required low-level nasal cannula supplemental oxygen and was somewhat breathless on exam. dyspnea: as mentioned, the likely etiology of his symptoms was dchf, but an alternate etiology possible. his initial cxr and bnp, along with his increasing weight, lower extremity edema, orthopnea, and pnd all pointed towards chf. he improved somewhat with diuresis (via lasix and nesiritide), beta-blockade (metoprolol 25 mg po bid) and then cardioversion from af to sinus rhythm. of note, a work-up for pulmonary embolism via cta at the hospital was negative. a persistent atelectasis versus infiltrate of his left lower lobe in the lung was observed. he was treated for pneumonia at the outside hospital and also received a five-day course of levofloxacin at (for a uti). chf: the admission echo showed an ef of 50%. again, the cause of his dysfunction was not known, but was likely diastolic, but the exact etiology was unknown. he was ruled out for acute myocardial infarction on admission. he had an isolated elevation of his ferritin level, but had no other signs of systemic hemochromatosis. futher, systemic amyloid was not apparent on exam, but was certainly a possible cause for his diastolic dysfunction. follow-up

patient is an 86 year old woman who came to ed with symptoms consistent with acute pulmonary edema and was treated as such with lasix 40 iv x 2 and a nitroglycerin drip. because of a subsequent drop in her bp, she was placed on bipap and dopamine for blood pressure support and transferred to the ccu. . the admission cxr was consistent with diffuse pulmonary edema. post diuresis, this significantly improved. in addition, on physical exam, crackles present on admission were no longer audible and she continued to have o2 sats in the mid 90s. she was then weaned off the dopamine and transferred to the floor. during her first day on the floor, her home carvedilol, lasix and lisinopril were all held since her bp was in the 90s. on the hod#4, these were restarted at carvedilol 125 , lisinopril 5 and lasix 40 po. and on hod#5, she was discharged on her home regimen. . during this admission, we also considered whether a catheterization would be necessary for this woman given her frequent hospitalizations with pulmonary edema. however, given the acute reversal of her symptoms and the fact that she did not reaccumulate fluid on her lungs or develop any signs of respiratory compromise and no signs of ischemia on her ekg, we felt that this could be postponed for now. she did have a slighly elevated troponin, but this was felt to be to stress. we did not feel that her lasix required uptitrating as she did not reaccumulate fluid after being off lasix for 2 full days during the hospitalization. she was discharged on her home medications. in addition, clopidogrel was added to her regimen in the event that these events were due to ischemia. . nutrition was asked to educate the patient on the necessity of adhering to a low salt","['D_507', 'D_428', 'D_426', 'D_599',

presented with aortic stenosis. her investigation included angiogram and echo which basically showed severe aortic stenosis with calcified tricuspid aortic valve and significant disease in the right coronary artery and also a patent foramen ovale and mild mitral regurgitation. her past medical history as mentioned above includes the lung cancer, stage iii, with also subsequent right sided pleural effusion as well as pericardial effusion for which she had pericardiocentesis in the past. she thoroughly investigated with pet scan, etc to rule out possibility of any secondaries which were all negative. after full discussion, she wanted to go ahead with the surgery. she was electively admitted for aortic valve replacement, coronary artery bypass graft, and patent foramen ovale closure. past

care unit for monitoring. she was noted to have severe facial and neck edema for which diuresis was initiated. her permenant pacemaker was interoggated by the electrophysiology service and reprogrammed. an underlying atrial fibrillation was noted. a heparin induced thrombocytopenia was sent for thrombocytopenia which was negative. on , mrs. was extubated however promptly developed respiratory distress requiring reintubation. the neurology service was consulted for anisocoria. a head ct scan was obtained which showed small areas of hypodensity within the left frontal lobe and right frontoparietal region, as well as within the subcortical white matter and corona radiata bilaterally. her anisocoria subsequently resolved. given her decreased level of consciouseness, the stroke service felt that she liklely experienced a cerebrovascular accident and coumadin should be started when it was safe. the thoracic surgery service was consulted for a tracheostomy. it was decided that she was indeed a candidate for a tracheostomy however given her history of radiation, an open procedure may be best. while changing a central line, mrs. became hypotensive which responded to resuscitation. the electrophysiology service was asked to evaluate her pacemaker which was found to be functioning within normal limits. slight changes were made to her sensing. rate control of her atrial fibrillation was recommended. the physical therapy worked with mrs. daily. on , the thoracic surgery service performed a tracheostomy without complication. a bronchoscopy was later performed which did not reveal significant secretions. the ventilator was slowly weaned to cpap. the speech and swallow service","['D_568', 'D_162', 'D_V42', 'D_496', 'D_453', 'D_793', 'D_285', 'D_272',

which he subsequently converted to a normal sinus rhythm. also on postoperative day four, he was found to be recovering well and safe for transfer to the inpatient floor for further recovery and rehabilitation. on postoperative day five, mr. had additional bursts of rapid atrial fibrillation; treated with intravenous lopressor as well as his oral amiodarone and lopressor doses. it was decided that he should be anticoagulated and was started on a heparin drip and oral coumadin. his cardiac pacing wires were also removed on postoperative day five. mr. continued to have coarse lungs with a productive cough; however, his sputum changed to yellow and no infection has been identified. on postoperative day six, he was noted to have some serous sternal drainage treated with betadine swabs and dry sterile dressing. on postoperative day seven, mr. was noted to have a continued scant amount of serous drainage from his sternal incision. he had an elevated white count up to 33, and he was therefore started on vancomycin intravenously, and a picc line was placed for potential long-term antibiotic administration. on postoperative day nine, mr. inr was elevated to 9; at which time his heparin drip was discontinued and he continued on his oral coumadin. his sternal drainage on postoperative days nine and ten was also noted to be significantly decreased. it was decided that he would continue on the vancomycin. mr. was followed by physical therapy throughout his hospital course, and it was decided that he was not safe for home and should continue with physical therapy and rehabilitation","['D_531', 'D_280', 'D_427', 'D_041', 'D_238', 'D_414', 'D_600', 'D_401', 'D_365', 'D_553', 'D_715', 'D_V45', 'D_V10']","['D_153', 'D_59', 'D_106', 'D_3', 'D_44', 'D_101', 'D_164', 'D_98', 'D_88', 'D_143', 'D_203', 'D_101', 'D_24']","['P_44', 'P_99', 'P_96']","['P_93', 'P_222', 'P_221']","['C0687813', 'C1359886']","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

pna: the patient was diagnosed with a pneumonia in the micu and treated with a seven day course of meropenem. on transfer to the floor, he was afebrile with no leukocytosis. in micu, he was thought to have multifocal pna based on imaging although sputum culture was negative. # chylous pleural effusion: the patient presented with significant right pleural effusion. thoracentesis demonstrated a chylous effusion. interventional pulmonology was consulted and stated that the effusion was likely from injury to the thoracic duct during his previous surgery. they placed a chest tube and recommended tpn with octretide to help decrease tryglyceride intake and chylous output. a picc line was placed in the left upper extremity on , and tpn was begun on . the plan was for pleurodesis when drainage was <100 to <125 cc/ day. however, as mentioned, the ct continued to put out a significant amount of fluid and as a result, the patient was transferred to the thoracics service where he underwent a vats and talc pleurodesis on . he was briefly intubated in sicu for respiratory acidosis and was extubated on . the chest tube was pulled with post xray showing possible small apical left pneumothorax. subsequent cxr showed resolution. thoracic surgery signed off prior to discharge and recommended continued dry dressings to the chest tube site. he will continue on tpn, po intake no more than 200cc/day, otherwise npo, with continued octreotide for another week. # copd: he was continued on atrovent and albuterol inharlers per his outpatient regimen. he has poor pulmonary reserve given his pneumonectomy. # chf: the patient has an ef 60%, but likely has a component of diastolic dysfunction. he was diuresed to euvolemia after receiving fluids in the micu and ed for resuscitation. given his elevated bicarb, he was started on diomax","['D_518', 'D_410', 'D_038', 'D_995', 'D_584', 'D_785', 'D_507', 'D_428', 'D_496', 'D_425', 'D_356', 'D_414', 'D_285', 'D_V10', 'D_V45']","['D_131', 'D_100', 'D_2', 'D_2', 'D_157', 'D_249', 'D_129', 'D_108', 'D_127', 'D_97', 'D_95', 'D_101', 'D_59', 'D_19', 'D_105', 'D_105']","['P_31', 'P_96', 'P_37', 'P_33', 'P_44', 'P_43', 'P_99', 'P_88', 'P_93']","['P_34', 'P_216', 'P_216', 'P_47', 'P_37', 'P_70', 'P_71', 'P_223', 'P_222', 'P_47', 'P_47', 'P_216']","['C0774583', 'C1359886', 'C0778320']","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

with a left axis deviation, still with 5-mm st elevations inferiorly. hospital course: on , the patient was on aspirin, lipitor, morphine, heparin, integrilin, and nitroglycerin drip. she was asymptomatic with no nausea, chest pain, chest pressure, shortness of breath, palpitations, or edema. her lung examination was markedly improved on her second hospital day with crackles halfway up. an echocardiogram was performed on which showed an ejection fraction of 50%. no aortic stenosis. mitral regurgitation of 2+ and 1+ tricuspid regurgitation. no effusions. the left atrium was mildly dilated with inferior wall motion abnormalities. a chest x-ray from early on showed likely congestive heart failure with a tortuous aorta, small pleural effusions (left greater than right), with pulmonary edema. there was a discussion on regarding taking the patient back to the catheterization laboratory for treatment of her left-sided disease. however, it was decided that at this time the culprit lesion was indeed the right coronary artery, and the left-sided lesions would possibly be corrected at a later date. on , the patient was placed on metoprolol 5 mg p.o. twice per day and given some as needed medications for her gas/bloating. she did have two brief hypotensive episodes to a systolic blood pressure of 90 which quickly corrected with 250-cc boluses times two. her creatine kinases trended down nicely from 3092 to 2199 to her mb fractions also trended down from 401 to 221 to on , the patient was changed from atorvastatin to fluvastatin because of a recent study indicating a mortality benefit from fluvastatin as opposed to atorvastatin when combined with plavix. on , the patient was also started on lisinopril 5 mg p.o. every day and changed to toprol-xl 25 mg p.o. once per day. a physical therapy consultation was obtained which showed the patient fully able to ambulate without becoming symptomatic. her foley catheter was discontinued.","['D_410', 'D_428',

details and summary. she had a mitral valve repair with a #28 annuloplasty band, tricuspid valve repair with a #32 annuloplasty band and primary closure of her atrial septal defect. the patient tolerated the procedure well. her bypass time was 98 minutes, crossclamp time 52 minutes. she was transferred from the operating room to the cardiothoracic intensive care unit. at the time of transfer, her mean arterial pressure was she was a-v paced at 88 beats per minute. she had neo-synephrine at 1 mcg/kg/minute and propofol at 10 mcg/kg/minute. the patient did well in the immediate postoperative period. her anesthesia was reversed, she was weaned from the ventilator and successfully extubated. she remained hemodynamically stable overnight. she did, however, require continuous neo-synephrine to maintain an adequate blood pressure. also of note, the patient's underlying rhythm was noted to be a nodal rhythm with a heart rate of on postoperative day number one, electrophysiology was called to assess the need for a permanent pacemaker given the patient's underlying rhythm. she remained in nodal rhythm for the next several days, during which time she was weaned from her neo-synephrine and all tubes, lines and drains were removed with the exception of her epicardial pacing wires. on postoperative day number three, the patient was brought to the electrophysiology laboratory, at which time she underwent permanent pacemaker placement. please see the electrophysiology note for full details. in summary, the patient had a permanent pacemaker placed with a vvi setting of 60 beats per minute with a rate set at over the next several days, the patient remained hemodynamically stable. her activity level was increased with the assistance of physical therapy and the nursing staff. on , it was decided that the patient was stable and ready to be discharged back to her facility. physical examination on discharge:","['D_562', 'D_285',

artery disease. he had reportedly been experiencing intermittent substernal chest pain for several years which he attributed to heart burn. however, two weeks prior to admission he experienced a prolonged episode which lasted for about an hour while he was driving which eventually subsided without any medical intervention. he was seen by his primary care physician about five days prior to his admission at which time he was started on atenolol for a newly-diagnosed hypertension. at that time he underwent an electrocardiogram which showed prior inferior myocardial infarction for which he was then referred for cardiac catheterization. cardiac catheterization was performed which revealed 50 percent left main coronary artery stenosis, 100 percent mid left anterior descending stenosis, 70 percent mid left circumflex artery stenosis and a 99 percent om stenosis with a 100 percent totally occluded right coronary artery. the patient had an ejection fraction of 30 percent with global left

arrest code lasted about 30 minutes. the patient was defibrillated six times and subsequently intubated. a sinus rhythm was able to be re-obtained. the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit. in the intensive care unit, the patient received intravenous calcium, kayexalate, insulin, glucose, and after correction of his hyperkalemia, actually began some hypokalemic requiring some repletion. the etiology of his acidemia remains unclear and cannot be attributed to a hyperkalemic state. after the admission, the renal service placed a left ij quinton catheter and the patient was dialyzed. creatinine urine output has been improving since the dialysis. the patient also received a bicarbonate infusion, and patient's serum bicarbonate repleted over 24 hours. as an outpatient, he has diffuse coronary artery disease on a cardiac catheterization in consistent with 100% proximal right coronary artery occlusion in a right dominant system with elevated mean wedge pressure at no

strips were unable to be obtained. the arrest is most likely secondary to from hyperkalemia, acidemia, however, there is old scar from a prior myocardial infarction and it is felt that the patient will likely need an outpatient electrophysiology consult to evaluate for a scar origination of his ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation arrest. patient was extubated on hospital day number

his bilateral femoropopliteal, patient's small left subclavian had diffuse disease, and bilateral radial arteries had diffuse disease and calcifications. it was felt that patient did not have adequate

defects in the anterior inferior walls. it also showed global severe left ventricular dysfunction. the catheterization results were reviewed, and the cardiology consult team determined that this patient was not a candidate for revascularization. neurologic: the patient's mental status cleared dramatically with the repletion of bicarb and intravenous fluids. his metabolic acidosis resolved. he required a total of 12 amps of bicarb and intravenous fluids, and the patient resumed his dose of bicitra to maintain a serum bicarb in the mid 20s. renal: on admission, the patient's bun and creatinine were elevated thought to be due to dehydration in combination with excessive nsaid use. the patient had taken 12 aspirin two days prior to admission for severe headache. with hydration, the creatinine and bun improved back down to his baseline between 9 and infectious disease: the patient was treated with levaquin for a klebsiella urinary tract infection. the urine cultures from grew

chest pain: the patient ruled out for myocardial infarction. however, with her history of disease, patient underwent a cardiac catheterization. the patient was found at cardiac catheterization to have mild diffuse instent restenosis in the mid stent, otherwise hemodynamically normal and the coronary arteries otherwise were without flow-limiting stenoses. the patient was then continued on her cardiac medications. it was felt that if we attempted aspirin desensitize her while an inpatient, then she would benefit from the use of aspirin and plavix. the patient was sent to the ccu and underwent aspirin desensitization protocol, which she tolerated well. she had mild worsening of her asthma attacks, which was relieved by benadryl and occasionally albuterol. the patient found that if she took the aspirin in the evening with her benadryl that she takes for sleep, that the asthma exacerbation did not occur. aspirin no longer should be considered an allergy for this patient, and she is going to take this as an outpatient. hyperlipidemia: the patient's lipitor was increased to 80 mg q.d. back pain: this is a chronic issue and was controlled with flexeril and vicodin. disposition:
