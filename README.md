<p align="center"><b>PatientTM - Patient Trajectory Modelling</b></p>

A solution for modelling patient trajectories, according to different clinical outcomes, using multimodal clinical information including clinical notes and coding data.

<!--
### New Features!

  - Annotate medication information in clinical notes
  - Harmonise the resulting information into their standard definition
  - Store extracted drug information into the OMOP CDM
-->
### Documentation

More documentation about the system and how to run it is available [here](https://github.com/bioinformatics-ua/PatientTM/wiki).

### Acknowledgements

We thank Kexin Huang for his publicly available repository for clinicalBERT, which was used as a base for exploring textual information from clinical notes. This repository was improved with numerous features, such as more robust data preprocessing and model validation mechanisms, and the resulting augmented version was integrated in PatientTM.
